    <h2 style="padding-left: 0.5em;">Invitation to our Common Sense Reasoning HITs</h2>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 1em;">
        Welcome! We'd like to promote our HITs on challenging
        AI's common sense.
    </h4>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 1em;">
        You may access these HITs here: <a target="_blank" href="https://worker.mturk.com/?filters%5Bsearch_term%5D=violet+peng+common+sense&page_size=100&filters%5Bqualified%5D=false&filters%5Bmasters%5D=false&sort=reward_desc&filters%5Bmin_reward%5D=0">MTurk Page Search Result</a>.
    </h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">
        According to the feedback we received from previous workers,
        they think these tasks are fun (the goal is to write sentences that fool the AI)
        and well-paid (~$2 in 10 mins).
        <br/><br/>
        However, as there is a qualification quiz for all our HITs,
        we found that MTurkers could easily miss
        the chance to participate if they keep the filter option
        "I'm qualified to work on" on when searching for HITs to do.
