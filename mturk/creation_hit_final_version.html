<h1>Common Sense Reasoning HIT - Creation</h1>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: darkred;"><b>Welcome! Please read this guideline carefully.</b></p>

<div>
<h3>Task Overview</h3>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 2em;">In this HIT, we ask you to test the common sense reasoning for our AI agent -- <b>Carl</b>, by developing sentence pairs for the combination of <b><mark style="background-color: cyan;"><span id="domain">${domain}</span></mark></b> domain and <b><mark style="background-color: cyan;"><span id="scenario">${scenario}</span></mark></b> scenario.</p>

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 4em;">
<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em;"><i>${eg_true_1}, ${eg_true_2}. <b style="color: darkgreen;">[True]</b></i></p>

<p>We can write its complement and change the correctness:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em;"><i>${eg_false_1}, ${eg_false_2}. <b style="color: darkred;">[False]</b></i></p>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 2em;"><mark>Your goal is to write challenging pairs that are easily understood by people&nbsp;but are more likely to fool <b>Carl</b> into judging them incorrectly.</mark></p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Payment</h3>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 2em; color: blue;">The base pay for completing this task is <b>${base_pay}</b>, and the bonus pay is <b><span id="sentence_bonus">${sentence_bonus}</span> * your score</b>. <b>Your score</b> is the number of sentences where you were able to successfully fool our agent <b>Carl</b>.<br />
In our internal study, we usually find ourselves able to fool once in each pair, i.e. our score = 3.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 2em; color:brown"><i>Note: You can expect to receive the full payment (base + bonus) in <b>${how_many_days}</b> days (we will validate and pay&nbsp;ASAP). Kindly ensure that all the sentences abide by our instructions, else your submission may not be eligible for a bonus, or could be completely rejected. </i></p>

<h4 style="line-height: 1.42857;"><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><u><strong>FAQs Collected from Exit Survey</strong></u></span></h4>

<p style="line-height: 1.42857;"><strong><u>​This part is optional reading, but please skim through it if you have time, as we think these are the common questions shared across MTurkers.</u></strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Q1.</strong> &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>if I was supposed to fool him with both lines or just the false one</strong></span>? I think it was just the false line right? I couldn&#39;t find in the instructions where it was explicitly stated.&quot;
<strong>Ans</strong>: <strong>You can fool Carl in any sentence and as many as you can (each valid sentence that fooled Carl will get you ${sentence_bonus} in bonus.</strong> The <strong><span style="color:#006400;">green</span> checkmark next to the sentence (hover to see what it means) indicates that you fooled Carl</strong>, and the red one indicates you didn&#39;t.

<strong>Q2. &quot;</strong>Is it correct to say that <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>the highest pay would be for submittable answers with six green checkmarks</strong></span>?&quot;
<strong>Ans: Yes, it is correct (assuming your inputs follow all the rules).
</strong><span style="color:#006400;"><em>With that being said, if a Carl-fooling sentence pair is well-constructed and creative enough, we tend to give a full bonus even if it is created for the wrong domain/scenario. However, please try your best to follow the domain/scenario as it will largely reduce our post-process work and thus speed up the bonus payment! Thank you.</em></span>

<strong>Q3.</strong> &quot;I want to know if the examples provided are <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>all examples conforming to the specific domains you were asking for in this HIT</strong></span>, or if they were generalized examples.&quot;
<strong>Ans</strong>: <strong>Yes, all the examples provided are conforming to the specific domain and scenario asked in this HIT.
</strong>
<strong>​Q4.</strong> &quot;I was curious as to <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>how much the sentences should be varied between the pair</strong></span>. Should they follow the template of the example, where the subjects are switched, and the sentence is essentially the same?&nbsp; Or should they be constructed differently to make it harder for the AI?&quot;
<strong>Ans: Yes, please follow the template to make sure that each sentence pair is contrastive (True vs. False) yet still about the same/very similar situation.
</strong>
<strong>Q5. </strong>&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure whether I should <strong><span style="color:#B22222;">spell out each number or not</span></strong>.&nbsp;The examples were all spelled out and the instructions said to do that for numbers over 1000, but did not specify if you should ONLY do that for those higher numbers?&quot;
<strong>Ans:</strong> <strong>For numbers less than 1000, you can use any format of your choice that reads naturally in a sentence</strong>. If you&#39;d like to use <strong>any numbers outside of non-negative integers</strong>, we ask you to <strong>describe them in the most common-sense way. Lastly, please try to only include numeracy for the numerical-social, numerical-physical and time domains.</strong>

<strong>Q6.</strong> &quot;Will you put in the directions on <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>how many of these HITs a person can complete</strong></span>, if they can do more than 1 or just 1?&quot;
<strong>Ans:</strong> <strong>Please do as many as you can.</strong> We (this common-sense reasoning HIT series) do not have any implicit constraint on the number of HITs each qualified MTurkers can do. <strong>However, please make sure that your creations are not repetitive. <span style="color:#006400;">If you plan to do multiple HITs (and we will continue to publish more), </span><u><span style="color:#006400;">we&#39;d recommend you to keep a list of your creations somewhere to avoid repetition</span></u>.
</strong>
<strong>Q7.</strong> &quot;<span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>It would be helpful to know if the AI is fooled by misunderstanding objects or context more often</strong></span>.&quot;
<strong>Ans:</strong> Nice catch! This is a very difficult question even for AI experts and researchers to have concrete answers for.
Indeed, one major reason that we started this project is to find out some clues to answer such a great question, or at least to promote discoveries and deeper understandings of common sense reasoning in language models (yes, our AI Agent Carl is equipped with a language model).
We are very interested to hear your thoughts on such questions &amp; welcome all interesting ideas and discussions, please do consider sharing them with us either in the exit survey or at <span style="color:#0000CD;"><u>mcspluslab@gmail.com</u></span>. All insightful ideas will be properly acknowledged!

<strong>Q8. &quot;</strong>I need <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>more help on how to fool him</strong></span>!&quot;
<strong>Ans: Sure! We totally understand and sometimes</strong> <strong>also experience difficulties fooling Carl. We are composing a new document to share inspiration and fooling tricks. Stay tuned!

-------------new-------------

Q9</strong>. &quot;I&rsquo;m wondering <span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>for the comparison ones, is it necessary to have both options in each of the sentences</strong></span>, or is it okay if the comparison comes from the two sentences as a pair?&quot;
<strong>Ans: <span style="color:#006400;">&nbsp;To clarify, for the comparison scenario, both options need to be included in each of the sentences. Otherwise, we consider the pair belonging to the causal-and-effect scenario instead.&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>

<u><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[PLEASE READ] Notice</span></strong></u>
1. If you ever find <u>the domain and scenario on our website not matching the domain and scenario as described on this page</u>, please try to either <strong>refresh</strong> our website page (link below), <strong>clear</strong> your <strong>cache</strong> or use the <strong>incognito/private mode</strong> of your browser. Please <u>make sure you work on the right domain and scenario</u>. Otherwise, the system will record your inputs under the wrong domain and scenario and <strong>could lead to bonus reduction</strong>.

2. Please be creative! The examples are provided to inspire you. We will have to <strong>reduce your bonus if your inputs are too similar to the example </strong>(e.g. same social/physical/temporal events with only a change of the character name).

3. If you find anything that we can improve on / want us to know, please don&#39;t hesitate to share them in the exit survey or directly email <strong><u>mcspluslab@gmail.com</u></strong>. We welcome and appreciate all feedback!

<u><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Optional reading] Our messages:</span></strong></u>
<strong>[Oct 29th]</strong>
​We really enjoy many of your smart inputs and please keep up the good work! #thumbsup
<u>We are collecting a list of creative MTurkers and preparing more tasks for them</u>. Stay tuned!

<strong>[Nov 8th]
Please notice the domain &amp; scenario update on our website.</strong>
We <em>sincerely apologize</em> for all your inconvenience caused by the previous survey link error. We will pay extra attention in the future and try our best to avoid any similar situation from happening again.
As always, thank you for your support and likes. Have fun fooling Carl!&nbsp;

<strong>[Nov 16th]
</strong>Please pay close attention to the <strong>domain and scenario required for your current task</strong>, as <strong>they can change</strong> in each HIT group and we are requesting so many different ones. Please make sure the domain and scenario you see here on MTurk matches with the later ones on our website (checkout <u><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Notice No.1</strong></span></u> if they didn&#39;t match). We want to pay you a full bonus, so please <strong>don&#39;t give us a chance to deduct your bonus simply because of a domain/scenario mismatch</strong>!

<strong>[Dec 3rd]​</strong>
​We&#39;ve invited the top 10 most creative MTurkers in our list to complete the first round of bonus HITs to help us with True/False verification. The result looks great! We again thank you all for the creative and high-quality inputs!
<span style="color:#B22222;">Starting this month, the team will accelerate our collection &amp; validation speed (if you are expecting bonus payment--the team is working on validation diligently right now!!)</span>. So, hang tight! More HITs and payments are on the way!
<strong>We&#39;ve added common problems we received from the exit survey into the FAQs above.</strong> For more specific comments, we will reach out to MTurkers individually if needed. Thank you for all your feedback and creative, hard work!

<strong><span style="color:#cc3366;">Last but not least, please promise to take care of yourselves, stay safe, and be positive and healthy!! </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#cc3366;">We wish everyone all the best. &lt;3</span></strong>
